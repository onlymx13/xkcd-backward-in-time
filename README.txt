Requires the latest version of `yt-dlp` (install via e.g. `pip`) and `ffmpeg` to build assets (required for the tectonic plates functionality to work). If you get error 403 while building assets, update `yt-dlp`.

Get assets (required before first run): `npm run build_assets`
Clean assets: `npm run clean_assets`
Run for development: `npm run vite`

TODO:
* CSS
* TODOs in the code/repo
* show an analog clock spinning? analog calendar?
